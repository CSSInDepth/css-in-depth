# CSS in Depth

Code listings from [CSS In Depth](https://manning.com/books/css-in-depth) by Keith J. Grant

_Note: These listings are for the first edition. For second edition listings, see [the second edition repository](https://github.com/cssindepth/css-in-depth-2)._

At first glance, it may appear that some listings are missingâ€”Because working examples requires both HTML and CSS, I have put most listings in an HTML file, using <style> tags for the CSS. This means that both an HTML listing and CSS listing are combined in one file in the repository.

For example, in Chapter 1, listing 1.1 is HTML code and listing 1.2 is CSS that is meant to be applied to that HTML. I have included these both in the repository in the file named ch01/listing-1.2.html. Changes are made to this CSS in ch01/listing 1.3; these are included in ch01/listing-1.3.html, along with the corresponding HTML from listing 1.1.
